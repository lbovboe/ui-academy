# File and Folder Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for all folders and all files except React component files.
- Use PascalCase for React component files only (e.g., `NavBar.tsx`).
- Component folders/directories must use kebab-case (e.g., `headers`, `footer`).
- Use lowercase for utility and hook files (e.g., `use-theme.ts`).
- Name context files as `SomethingContext.tsx`.
- Name page files as `page.tsx` within their route directory.
