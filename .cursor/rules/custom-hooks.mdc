# Custom Hooks Guidelines

- Prefix all custom hooks with `use` (e.g., `useTheme`, `useUserData`).
- Place hooks in a `hooks` or relevant feature directory.
- Keep hooks focused on a single responsibility.
- Type all hook parameters and return values.
- Reuse hooks across components where possible.
