# Component Structure Rules

- Use PascalCase for all component file and directory names (e.g., `NavBar.tsx`, `ThemeToggle.tsx`).
- Place each component in its own directory if it has related files (styles, tests, subcomponents).
- Group related components under feature or domain folders (e.g., `app/components/Headers/`).
- Export components as default unless there is a strong reason to use named exports.
- Keep components focused: one component per file, unless tightly coupled.
- Use `.tsx` for all React components.
- Place shared UI components in a `components` directory, and feature-specific components in their respective feature folders.
