# Context Organization

- Place all context providers in a `context` directory or relevant feature folder.
- Name context files as `SomethingContext.tsx`.
- Export both the context and a custom hook for consuming the context (e.g., `useTheme`).
- Keep context logic focused and avoid large, monolithic providers.
