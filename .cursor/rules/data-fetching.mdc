# Data Fetching with TanStack Query

- Use TanStack Query (React Query) for all client-side data fetching.
- Encapsulate query logic in custom hooks (e.g., `useUserData`).
- Use query keys that are descriptive and unique.
- Handle loading, error, and success states in the UI.
- Use mutations for POST/PUT/DELETE requests.
- Avoid direct fetch calls in components; always use hooks.
